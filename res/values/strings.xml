    <string name="about">The original Unix Finger program was written by Les Earnest in
    1971 and was designed to retrieve information about users on a network. This 
    protocol has largely fallen out of grace and is rarely used. 
    \nGood luck finding an open Finger server on which to test this client. 
    \n\nThis version of the Unix Finger client was implemented by John Selmys at 
    Seneca College in Toronto - 2011.
